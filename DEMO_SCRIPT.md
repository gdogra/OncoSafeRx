## Demo Script Options

## 5-Minute Executive Demo

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
*"Thank you for your time today. Before we dive in, let me ask: when your oncologists need to check drug interactions for a cancer patient taking 15+ medications, how long does that currently take?"*

*[Wait for response]*

*"What I'm going to show you in the next 5 minutes is how OncoSafeRx reduces that from a 10-15 minute research process to a 30-second clinical decision."*

### Problem Context (45 seconds)
*"The numbers here are staggering: 125,000 preventable deaths annually from drug interactions, costing healthcare $40+ billion. In oncology, this problem is amplified because cancer patients average 12+ simultaneous medications, and existing tools like Lexicomp aren't designed for the complexity of cancer pharmacotherapy."*

*[Share screen to OncoSafeRx platform]*

### Live Demo - Core Workflow (3 minutes)

**Step 1: Drug Search (45 seconds)**
*"Let me show you our FDA-integrated drug search. I'm looking up pembrolizumab - notice how it immediately surfaces oncology-specific information, not just general drug data."*

*[Navigate to drug search, type "pembrolizumab"]*

*"See how we prioritize cancer medications and show immediate contraindications? This is purpose-built for oncology workflows."*

**Step 2: Interaction Checking (90 seconds)**
*"Now, here's where it gets powerful. Let's say I have a patient on pembrolizumab who needs to start warfarin for a DVT - a common scenario in cancer care."*

*[Demonstrate drug interaction checking]*

*"Watch what happens... The system immediately flags not just the interaction, but provides oncology-specific guidance. See this recommendation about monitoring protocols? That's based on NCCN guidelines, not general medicine protocols."*

**Step 3: Pharmacogenomic Insights (45 seconds)**
*"But here's what sets us apart: pharmacogenomic integration. Based on this patient's CYP2D6 status..."*

*[Show pharmacogenomic recommendations]*

*"...we're recommending a 25% dose reduction and specific monitoring schedule. This is personalized medicine in real-time."*

### Value Proposition Close (30 seconds)
*"The result? What used to take 10-15 minutes of research across multiple systems now takes 30 seconds. Fewer adverse events, better outcomes, reduced liability exposure."*

*"What questions can I answer about how this would integrate with your current workflow at [Their Organization]?"*
