# Introduction to Pharmacogenomics

Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is the study of how genetic variations affect individual responses to medications.

## What is Pharmacogenomics?

Pharmacogenomics combines pharmacology and genomics to develop safe and effective medications tailored to an individual's genetic makeup.

### Key Concepts

**Genetic Polymorphisms**: Variations in genes that affect drug metabolism, transport, or targets

**Phenotypes**: Observable characteristics resulting from genetic variations:
- **Poor Metabolizer (PM)**: Reduced enzyme activity
- **Intermediate Metabolizer (IM)**: Somewhat reduced activity
- **Normal Metabolizer (NM)**: Normal enzyme activity
- **Rapid Metabolizer (RM)**: Increased enzyme activity
- **Ultra-rapid Metabolizer (UM)**: Very high enzyme activity

## Important Pharmacogenes in Oncology

### CYP2D6
- **Drugs affected**: Tamoxifen, codeine, tramadol
- **Clinical impact**: Tamoxifen efficacy depends on CYP2D6 activity
- **Recommendations**: Consider alternative therapy for poor metabolizers

### CYP2C19
- **Drugs affected**: Proton pump inhibitors, clopidogrel
- **Clinical impact**: Varies efficacy of acid suppression and antiplatelet therapy
- **Recommendations**: Dose adjustments or alternative medications

### TPMT (Thiopurine S-methyltransferase)
- **Drugs affected**: 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, thioguanine
- **Clinical impact**: Risk of severe myelosuppression
- **Recommendations**: Dose reduction or alternative therapy for poor metabolizers

### DPYD (Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase)
- **Drugs affected**: 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine
- **Clinical impact**: Risk of severe toxicity
- **Recommendations**: Dose reduction or avoid in deficient patients

### UGT1A1
- **Drugs affected**: Irinotecan
- **Clinical impact**: Risk of severe diarrhea and neutropenia
- **Recommendations**: Dose reduction for specific genotypes

## CPIC Guidelines

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) provides evidence-based guidelines for implementing pharmacogenetic testing.

### CPIC Recommendation Levels
- **Level A**: Strong recommendation for genetic testing
- **Level B**: Moderate recommendation
- **Level C**: Optional recommendation
- **Level D**: No recommendation

## Using PGx Information in OncoSafeRx
