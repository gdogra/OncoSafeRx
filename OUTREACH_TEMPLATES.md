## Demo Script Outline

### 5-Minute Quick Demo Script

**Opening (30 seconds):**
"Thank you for taking time to see OncoSafeRx. In the next 5 minutes, I'll show you how we're solving the $40 billion medication error problem specifically in oncology care."

**Problem Setup (1 minute):**
"Every year, 125,000 patients die from preventable drug interactions. In oncology, this problem is worse because cancer patients take an average of 12+ medications simultaneously, and existing tools like Lexicomp aren't designed for the complexity of cancer pharmacotherapy."

**Solution Demo (3 minutes):**
1. **Drug Search:** "Here's our FDA-integrated drug search - notice it prioritizes oncology medications..."
2. **Interaction Checking:** "When I check pembrolizumab against this patient's current medications, watch what happens..."
3. **Pharmacogenomic Insights:** "Based on this patient's genetic profile, here are the specific dosing recommendations..."

**Value Proposition (30 seconds):**
"This takes what used to be a 15-minute research process and makes it a 30-second clinical decision. The result? Fewer adverse events, better outcomes, and reduced liability."

**Call to Action:**
"What questions can I answer about integration with your existing workflow?"

### 15-Minute Detailed Demo Script

**Extended sections include:**
- Technical architecture overview (2 minutes)
- EHR integration mockup (3 minutes)  
- Analytics and reporting dashboard (2 minutes)
- Business model and pricing discussion (3 minutes)

## Objection Handling Scripts

### "We already use Lexicomp/Epocrates"
**Response:** "That's great - most of our prospects start with general drug information tools. The difference is that OncoSafeRx is purpose-built for oncology complexity. While Lexicomp covers thousands of drugs, we focus specifically on cancer treatments and their unique interaction patterns. Think of us as the specialist where Lexicomp is the general practitioner."

### "Integration seems complex"
**Response:** "Actually, that's why we built modern APIs from day one. Our integration is typically complete in 2-4 weeks compared to 6+ months for legacy systems. We have pre-built connectors for Epic, Cerner, and Allscripts, and our technical team handles the integration process."

### "What about regulatory compliance?"
**Response:** "Regulatory compliance was our starting point, not an afterthought. We use only FDA-approved data sources, follow HIPAA guidelines, and our architecture is designed for SOC 2 compliance. Our regulatory foundation is actually one of our key competitive advantages."

### "How do you compare to [Competitor]?"
**Response:** "Great question. [Competitor] does X well, but they're designed for general medicine. OncoSafeRx is the only platform that combines oncology-specific protocols with real-time pharmacogenomic insights. The depth of cancer expertise makes all the difference in complex cases."
