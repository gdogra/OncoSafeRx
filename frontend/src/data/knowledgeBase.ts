# Introduction to Pharmacogenomics

Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is the study of how genetic variations affect individual responses to medications.

## What is Pharmacogenomics?

Pharmacogenomics combines pharmacology and genomics to develop safe and effective medications tailored to an individual's genetic makeup.

### Key Concepts

**Genetic Polymorphisms**: Variations in genes that affect drug metabolism, transport, or targets

**Phenotypes**: Observable characteristics resulting from genetic variations:
- **Poor Metabolizer (PM)**: Reduced enzyme activity
- **Intermediate Metabolizer (IM)**: Somewhat reduced activity
- **Normal Metabolizer (NM)**: Normal enzyme activity
- **Rapid Metabolizer (RM)**: Increased enzyme activity
- **Ultra-rapid Metabolizer (UM)**: Very high enzyme activity

## Important Pharmacogenes in Oncology

### CYP2D6
- **Drugs affected**: Tamoxifen, codeine, tramadol
- **Clinical impact**: Tamoxifen efficacy depends on CYP2D6 activity
- **Recommendations**: Consider alternative therapy for poor metabolizers

### CYP2C19
- **Drugs affected**: Proton pump inhibitors, clopidogrel
- **Clinical impact**: Varies efficacy of acid suppression and antiplatelet therapy
- **Recommendations**: Dose adjustments or alternative medications

### TPMT (Thiopurine S-methyltransferase)
- **Drugs affected**: 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, thioguanine
- **Clinical impact**: Risk of severe myelosuppression
- **Recommendations**: Dose reduction or alternative therapy for poor metabolizers

### DPYD (Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase)
- **Drugs affected**: 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine
- **Clinical impact**: Risk of severe toxicity
- **Recommendations**: Dose reduction or avoid in deficient patients

### UGT1A1
- **Drugs affected**: Irinotecan
- **Clinical impact**: Risk of severe diarrhea and neutropenia
- **Recommendations**: Dose reduction for specific genotypes

## CPIC Guidelines

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) provides evidence-based guidelines for implementing pharmacogenetic testing.

### CPIC Recommendation Levels
- **Level A**: Strong recommendation for genetic testing
- **Level B**: Moderate recommendation
- **Level C**: Optional recommendation
- **Level D**: No recommendation

## Using PGx Information in OncoSafeRx

### 1. Enter Patient Genetic Information
- Input known genetic test results
- Use standardized nomenclature
- Include relevant phenotype predictions

### 2. Review Drug-Specific Recommendations
- CPIC guideline summaries
- Dosing recommendations
- Alternative medication suggestions

### 3. Clinical Decision Support
- Automated alerts for high-risk combinations
- Dosing calculators
- Monitoring recommendations

## Clinical Implementation

### When to Consider PGx Testing
- Before starting medications with strong PGx evidence
- After adverse drug reactions
- For patients with family history of drug reactions
- In precision medicine protocols

### Interpreting Results
- Understand the specific gene-drug pairs
- Consider phenotype predictions
- Account for other clinical factors
- Document decisions and rationale

### Patient Education
- Explain the role of genetics in drug response
- Discuss implications for current and future medications
- Provide genetic test results summary
- Encourage sharing with other healthcare providers

## Limitations and Considerations

### Test Limitations
- Not all relevant genes may be tested
- Rare variants may not be detected
- Phenotype prediction may not always correlate with clinical response

### Clinical Factors
- Drug interactions can affect PGx predictions
- Disease state may influence drug metabolism
- Age and organ function remain important
- Environmental factors can modify genetic effects

## Future Directions

- Expanded gene panels
- Improved phenotype prediction algorithms
- Integration with electronic health records
- Cost-effectiveness studies
- Population-specific research

Pharmacogenomics represents a key component of personalized medicine in oncology, helping optimize drug selection and dosing for individual patients.
